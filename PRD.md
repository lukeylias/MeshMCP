## **Product Requirements Document: Model Context Protocol (MCP) Server for Mesh Design System**

**v1.0**

**July 31, 2025**

### **1. Introduction/Purpose**

This document outlines the product requirements for a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that will act as a bridge between AI-powered development tools, such as Cursor.ai, and the Mesh Design System. The strategic importance of this MCP server is to enhance developer productivity and ensure design consistency by enabling AI assistants to natively understand and utilize our design system. By exposing Mesh components and their documentation through a standardized protocol, we can streamline the UI development process, reduce the learning curve for new developers, and ensure that AI-generated code adheres to our established design patterns and best practices.

### **2. Goals**

- **Component Discovery:** Enable AI assistants to retrieve a list of all available components within the Mesh Design System.
- **Detailed Component Information:** Allow AI assistants to access comprehensive details for any given component, including its properties (props), usage guidelines, and code examples.
- **Accurate Code Generation:** Facilitate the generation of correct and context-aware code that utilizes Mesh components with their proper props and styling.
- **Improved Developer Experience:** Provide a seamless and efficient workflow for developers using AI-powered tools to build UIs with Mesh components.

### **3. Key Features (MCP Tools to Expose)**

#### **Tool 1: `listComponents`**

- **Description:** Provides a comprehensive list of all available UI components in the Mesh Design System (storybook).
- **Input:** None.
- **Output:** A JSON array of component names.
  - _Example:_ `["Accordion", "Alert", "Autocomplete", "Button", "Card", "Checkbox", "Checkbox Group", "Copy", "Date Picker", "Date Textbox", "Divider", "Error Template", "Expander", "Expander Group", "Feature Panel", "File Upload", "Footer", "Fonts", "Form", "Form Control", "Grow Layout", "Header", "Header Footer Layout", "Heading", "Hero Panel", "Icons", "Info Box", "Link", "Loader", "Logo", "Modal", "ModeProvider", "Overlay", "Product Card", "Progress Stepper", "Radio", "Radio Button", "Radio Group", "React HTML", "Select", "Simple Table", "Skip Link", "Table", "Tabs", "Tag", "Textarea", "Textbox", "Theme", "Tooltip", "Utility Button", "Villain Panel"]`
- **Data Source:** Web scraping the main design system site and Storybook.

#### **Tool 2: `getComponentDetails`**

- **Description:** Fetches detailed information for a specific component.
- **Input:** `componentName` (string, e.g., "Accordion").
- **Output:** A JSON object containing:
  - `name` (string): The name of the component.
  - `description` (string): A description of the component and its use.
  - `props` (JSON object): A mapping of prop names to their type, description, and default value.
  - `codeExamples` (array of strings or objects): Code snippets demonstrating component usage.
  - `storybookUrl` (string): A direct link to the component's Storybook page.
  - `designGuidance` (string): Brief notes on when and how to use the component.
- **Data Source:** Web scraping the Storybook site for the specific component's documentation page.

#### **(Optional) Tool 3: `getDesignTokens`**

- **Description:** Provides core design tokens (e.g., colors, typography, spacing).
- **Input:** `tokenType` (string, e.g., "colors") or none to retrieve all.
- **Output:** A JSON object representing the design tokens.
- **Data Source:** Web scraping from https://www.meshdesignsystem.com/design-tokens/tokens-reference

### **4. Technical Specifications**

- **Protocol:** Model Context Protocol (MCP). JSON over HTTP/HTTPS.
- **Preferred Language/Framework:**
  - **Python:** FastAPI or Flask with libraries like BeautifulSoup or Playwright for web scraping.
  - **Node.js:** Express with libraries like Cheerio or Playwright for web scraping.
- **Deployment:** The application should be containerized using Docker for portability and ease of deployment.
- **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling for scenarios such as:
  - Component not found.
  - Web scraping failures.
  - Invalid input.
- **Performance:** To optimize performance and reduce redundant scraping, a caching mechanism should be implemented for the scraped data. The cache should be refreshed periodically or on-demand to reflect updates to the design system.
- **Security:** If the MCP server is exposed to the public internet, it should be placed behind a secure gateway or proxy. Access should be limited to authorized clients or networks.

### **5. API Endpoints (as per MCP Spec)**

- **`GET /tools`:** Returns the MCP manifest, which is a list of the available tools (`listComponents`, `getComponentDetails`, `getDesignTokens`).
- **`POST /tools/{tool_name}/invoke`:** Used to execute a specific tool. The request body will contain the necessary inputs for the tool.

### **6. Success Criteria**

- Cursor.ai (or another MCP-compatible client) can successfully call the `listComponents` tool and display the components from the Mesh Design System.
- Cursor.ai can retrieve accurate and complete details for any specified component using the `getComponentDetails` tool.
- AI-assisted code generation produces valid code that correctly implements Mesh components and their props.
- The MCP server demonstrates stability and high availability with minimal downtime.

### **7. Out of Scope**

- **Authentication and Authorization:** The initial version will not include user-specific authentication or authorization mechanisms.
- **Advanced Management UI:** A dedicated user interface for managing scraped data or configuring the MCP server is not in scope for v1.0.
- **Real-time Synchronization:** The server will rely on periodic re-scraping for updates. Real-time synchronization with the design system is not a requirement for the initial release.
