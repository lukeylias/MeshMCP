# Dependency Fix Summary

## âœ… Issues Fixed

### 1. **MCP Package Import Error**
**Problem:** `from mcp.server.fastmcp import FastMCP` was using incorrect import path

**Solution:**
- Changed package from `mcp>=1.0.0` to `fastmcp>=0.2.0`
- Updated import to: `from fastmcp import FastMCP`

### 2. **httpx Version Compatibility**
**Problem:** `httpx==0.25.2` was pinned to old version

**Solution:** Updated to `httpx>=0.27.0` for better async support and compatibility

### 3. **Pydantic Version Range**
**Problem:** `pydantic==2.5.0` was too strict, could cause conflicts

**Solution:** Changed to `pydantic>=2.5.0,<3.0.0` to allow patch/minor updates while preventing breaking changes

### 4. **Dependency Version Pinning**
**Problem:** All packages were strictly pinned (==), making updates difficult

**Solution:** Changed to flexible ranges (>=) for all packages except major version boundaries

```bash
cd /Users/luke.ylias/Documents/GitHub/MeshMCP

# Create virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
playwright install chromium

python3 test_mcp.py
```

### Upgrade Existing Environment
```bash
cd /Users/luke.ylias/Documents/GitHub/MeshMCP

# Upgrade all packages
pip install -r requirements.txt --upgrade
playwright install chromium

# Test
python3 test_mcp.py
```

## Verification

After installation, run:
```bash
python3 test_mcp.py
```

You should see:
```
